Check out [GitHub release](https://github.com/TukangM/Windows10-11-iso/releases) for Windows ISO
# Check last stable release on Wikipedia (For me only for check last stable)
[Windows 10](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_10)<br />
[Windows 11](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_11)<br />
im check and update every:
- 4 month for Cumulative Update for windows 10
- 2-3 month for Non-Cumulative Update for Windows 11
the iso compiled on linux with uup dump https://uupdump.net/, me when complete compiling isos i upload to archive.org cause github release max size is 2gb
Windows Edition :
 - Home
 - Pro
#
For some reason uupdump generate iso are wrong. so when you download iso. the build number are same as release build number

# For GitHub staff
please dont remove or suspend this account maybe you look my workspaces and you notice im installing VNC and xfce4, with that me can easyly compiling windows isos with gui (maybe you know uupdump compile windows isos without gui, but i use as easy copy move files, etx , idk i have no words)

# Alternative Workspace
i am trying to find another workspace to lighten the load on github codespaces<br />
(still using github codespaces as compiling iso)
