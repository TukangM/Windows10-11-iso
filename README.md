#
the iso compiled on linux with uup dump https://uupdump.net/. me when complete compiling iso i upload to archive.org cause github release max size is 2gb<br />
# Windows Edition :
 - Home
 - Pro
#
For some reason uupdump generate iso are wrong. so when you download iso. the build number are same as release build number
